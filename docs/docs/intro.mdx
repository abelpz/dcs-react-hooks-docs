<DataConsumer/>

**dcs-react-hooks** is an RHL (React Hooks Library) to streamline data fetching from [**DCS** (Door43 Content Service)](https://git.door43.org/about), a *Github*-like Git repository hosting service for open-licensed Biblical content.

It provides two group of hooks:

- **Client Hooks**, return [**dcs-js**](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/dcs-js) classes instances (Clients) that will allow you to take advantage of their methods to fetch data from DCS.
- **Request Hooks**, return *state* and *actions* directly from a DCS API paths. It will allow you to get state right-away and the actions needed to manipulate that state data both locally and remotely.

## Getting Started

To get started **run the following** inside your React project directory:

```bash
yarn add dcs-react-hooks
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install dcs-react-hooks
```

## Quick start

**Client hooks** and **Request hooks** can be used to produce the same result, in this example we'll fetch a list of all Organizations from DCS, using both Client and Request hooks.

We'll use a library called `react-json-view` to better see the results of the requests examples.

### The Client Hooks way

Start by importing the `useOrgClient` hook:

```js
import ReactJson from 'react-json-view';
// highlight-next-line
import { useOrgClient } from "dcs-react-hooks"
```

Then create a React Component for fetching all organizations from DCS and displaying the data.

```jsx live
function OrgClientJson(){
  const orgClient = useOrgClient({});
  const [orgs, setOrgs] = useState({});

  useEffect(async () => {
    const _orgs = await orgClient.orgGetAll().then(({ data }) => data)
    setOrgs(_orgs)
  },[]);

  return(
    <JsonView src={orgs} />
  )
}
```

You can see a complete list of the available parameters for the `orgGetAll` method in the [dcs-js documentation](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/dcs-js/blob/master/documentation/classes/OrganizationApi.md#orggetall).

### The Request Hooks way

Start by importing the `useAllOrgs` hook:

```js
import ReactJson from 'react-json-view';
// highlight-next-line
import { useAllOrgs } from "dcs-react-hooks"
```

Then create a React Component for fetching all organizations from DCS and displaying the data.

```jsx live
function OrgRequestJson(){
  const {state, actions} = useAllOrgs({});

  return(
    <JsonView src={{state,actions}} />
  )
}
```
